9:30 - 9:55 -> PTV-2934: ipad orientation issue. 4 orientations issues: when going from portrait:
							 - left menu on movies/genre is locked 
							 - assets pictures are too big (not enough room for title + metadata)
							 - ios 7 adds 20 pixels in landscape, and scrolls down, making the first entry of the left menu look cut out
							 - UI seems extremely slow: over scroll to create the bouncy effect takes a long time and isn't fluid at all
