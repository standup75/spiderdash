Where are we at?
----------------

DONE:
- PoolFactory (http://buildnewgames.com/)
- performance tests
- avoid canvas context change
- avoid vector graphics
from http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/
- check and remove floating point coordinates
- clear canvas at every refresh (context.clearRect(0, 0, width, height)), put a layer for fg, bg drawn only when resolvepath is done
- Ennemy: play with color on the frames, red goes faster, K2000 effect
- CMS
- put the sprite in the poolFactory (because I never really destroy them)
- world are path with levels as checkpoints (ala Mario)
- levels have stars (3 stars === max bonus), the spider needs to touch the star to collect it, putting the star in the web destroys it (and save this in gameProgress.stars)
- Save progression in local storage
- that game should not start until all the images are loaded, add a loader
- End of level bonus
- tutorial abstract class
- Sync profile
- highscore save in gameProgress (and restoreGameProgress)
- Quit game (esc key and add button next to pause)
- pause button disappear when it can impede spider's movement
- Go to next world
- Nice free fonts
- Compare different solution to port it to Android (directCanvas, canvas, libGdx)
- Android try run
- no more DOM, everything in canvases
- make bonuses bounce
- New ennemies: electric line, roach, chameleon
- Add vintage video game references:
  - replace punch by pacman pills (pill.png created)
- Life/Level not global, retry button instead of gameover
- Bonus level unlocking mechanism: If N is the number of available stars, when the player has N-9 stars, the bonus level is unlocked. By N-15, a first hint is displayed on the level, by N-12, a second hint.... There could be several ways to then access the bonus level, depending on the hint: "Go/back/to/level/1", here are 5 hints, then on level one a door is available where the spider can go to access the bonus level. Other hints "kill/him/on/level/1", "close/50%/on/level/3", "kill/them/with/one/pill/on/level/4", "don't/kill/roach/on/level/5"... Bonus level are centipede with pacman bonuses
- centipede bonus level with pacman bonuses (cherry, strawberry, pumpkin, pretzel, apple, pear, banana...)
- The main map contains all the worlds, every 5 levels, unlocks a world (4 worlds of 15 levels + 1 bonus stage: 4*15+20+5 = 85 levels). Changes the checkpoint object: need to have params: type (stage|world gate|bonus stage), level_id, index, world_id
- The smallest surface should be determined by linking the first and last point from the drawing path
- 3 2 1 go pause when you lose a life
- Level reordering tool: backend /levels should provide a way to reorder the levels
- World unlocking mecanism:
  - There is a minimum number of stars the player needs to collect before unlocking a world
  - Clicking on a locked world display the amount of stars needed
- Accessibility for no mouse/trackpad: keyboard only should work
- Redo text arrow (pointer)
- revisit tutorial, redesign arrows
- Relocate sprite circles
- add red stars that cannot be destroyed
- create special stars and sequence for level that waits until each star get caught and then ends the level
- add a level with tutorial on how to catch a star
- Ice
- Wait for key up after key down to reactivate key down
- fly smell you
- Fire
- level speed setting
- Save checkpoints: every 3 level put a flag between the level and the next one. Flag becomes red, game is saved.
- Check we cannot resave a game by redoing the level that leads to a flag (the number of stars for this level must be null in the localStorage in order to save)
- Game over. timer + skip button => home
- hide worlds until you reach it. Put bubbles and then the world appears when bubbles pop
- bugs with ladybug inside the path still occurs, need a waterproof solution
- add tutorial sequence "Get a green mustache!"
- Sequences have skip events and can run asynchronously
- Switch to a more puzzle mode: No more lives, Save at each level
- World Map: Click during sequence should work
- Crouching: When hitting the direction of the wall, the spider does not move.
- Deadly Zone
- Massacre: all monster killed bonus
- leaves should not kill through walls
- check the number of stars before unlocking a mustache
- Repair Secret Level in the Woods
- Mustaches added dynamically on offscreen canvas
- finish the yeah animation
- Crouching as a switch: create crouching animation
- Can't change wall if there is no space, should be able to connect
- Fine tune ladybug's getRect
- Spider rotates on edges
- Create ladybug nest
- Sprites on path: solve the thin wall collision issue while monster is turning
- Ladybugs come on the wrong side if closing the path on them
- Textures in walls.png
- Crack as roach nest
- Better direction responses in tight curves
- make it obvious where to click when displaying the world map

- 600x1.08 X 950x1.08 -> 720 x 1026
- tiles: 25 x 25 -> 27 x 27
- update tilecountx and tilecounty
- update levels with 2 more y tiles

- Islands
- More puzzle monsters:
  - Snails leave a poisonous trail

LEVEL DESIGN IDEAS

- A world map could be:
  - a big animal skelton
  - broken windows of a mansion
- Add vintage video game references:
  - add a space invader in a background
  - bomberman bombs
  - tetris level where the wall look like the tetris tiles
  - something from the first luigi and mario??
  - super mario tube with plants
- bonus stages:
  - Original (like Qyx)
